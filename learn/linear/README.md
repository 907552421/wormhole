# Linear Method

Given data pairs *(x,y)*, the linear method learns the model vector *w* by minizing the
following objective function:

where *â„“* is the loss function such as logistic loss and hinge loss.


## Build and Run

First to go the root directory of `wormhole`, then build by `make linear`. Now
train a small dataset in local machine by 1 worker and 1 server:

```
tracker/dmlc_local.py -n 1 -s 1 bin/linear.dmlc learn/linear/guide/demo.conf
```
